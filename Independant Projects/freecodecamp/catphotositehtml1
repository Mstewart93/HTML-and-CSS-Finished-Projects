<h2>Cat Form</h2>
        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo"> <!--This tells it where to submit the form -->
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required> <!--The required part will make it so they have to fill it out-->

<!--Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, 
The button you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button 
to make it clear that it is a submit button.-->

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

<!--You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.-->

<input type="radio"> Indoor

<!--label elements are used to help associate the text for an input 
element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). -->

<label><input type="radio">Outdoor</label>

<!--To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, 
    both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value-->
   <br>
    <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
    <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>


<!--If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. 
    Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you 
    have multiple buttons.

Add a value attribute to both radio buttons. For convenience, set the button's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.-->

<br>
<label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
<label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>


<!--The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. 
    fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.-->

    <fieldset>
        <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
        <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
      </fieldset>
<!--The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. 
    It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.-->

      <fieldset>
        <legend> Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? </legend>
        <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
        <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
        <label><input id="consent" type="checkbox" required> By checking this I agree to the terms and conditions. </label>
      </fieldset>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>

      <!--Add the name attribute with the value personality to the checkbox input element.

While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form,
 especially when there are multiple checkboxes.
-->

<!--Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The id attribute value should be lazy and the name attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox.

Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with the text Lazy. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox using the for attribute.

Submit and go to next challenge
-->

<input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> <label for="loving">Loving</label>
<input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality"> <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>

<!--Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.

Add a value attribute to each checkbox. For convenience, set each checkbox's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.-->

<!--n order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Make the first radio button and the first checkbox selected by default.-->
